    "question": "If the Runner accesses an agenda that would earn them 7 agenda points with 0 cards in their grip, who wins the game?",
    "answer": "The Runner wins the game in the checkpoint following the steal. The [Jinteki: Personal Evolution](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31050) ability has become pending, but would only resolve in the reaction window following this checkpoint. Since the Runner has won the game in this checkpoint, the game has ended and that reaction window never happens."
