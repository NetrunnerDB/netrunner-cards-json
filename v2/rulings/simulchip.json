    "answer": "No. Harbinger still counts as having been trashed, even though its ability replaces moving it to the heap with turning it facedown.\n\nIf the Runner uses Aesop's Pawnshop to trash a Harbinger that is already facedown, do they have to pay the additional cost to use Simulchip that turn?"
