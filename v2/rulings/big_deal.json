    "question": "What does “You may score that card, if able.” mean?",
    "answer": "Normally, resolving a **terminal** operation would skip all remaining paid ability windows this turn where the Corp can score an agenda. This effect provides an opportunity to score outside of a paid ability window, but the Corp still needs to meet the advancement requirement of the agenda and any other requirements in effect."
