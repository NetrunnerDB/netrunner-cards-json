    "question": "####[NISEI](https://nisei.net) [Uprising Release Notes](https://nisei.net/files/Uprising_Release_Notes.pdf) [NISEI Rules Team]\nIf the Runner installs a non-AI icebreaker and then hosts Adjusted Matrix on it, does that icebreaker lose the strength bonus from Cybertrooper Talut?",
    "answer": "No. Cybertrooper Talut only cares whether the program is an AI or not at the time it is installed. Once the strength bonus is applied, the ability does not continue checking the program's subtypes."
