    "question": "What happens if the Runner has a mandatory ability that would prevent the tag from [Funhouse](30054), such as the ability on [Jesminder Sareen: Girl Behind the Curtain](10006)?",
    "answer": "Players cannot attempt to pay a cost that would be prevented. If Jesminder Sareen’s ability is applicable, the Runner must choose to end the run."
