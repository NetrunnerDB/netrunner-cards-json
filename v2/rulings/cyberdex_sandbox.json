    "question": "####[NISEI](https://nisei.net) [Uprising Release Notes](https://nisei.net/files/Uprising_Release_Notes.pdf) [NISEI Rules Team]\nCan the Corp purge virus counters even if there are none in play?",
    "answer": "Yes. Per rule 10.1.1a, the Corp can always use an effect that purges virus counters, even if that effect would not normally be determined to have the potential to change the game state.\n\nWhen the Corp scores Cyberdex Sandbox, does its second ability allow them to trigger its first ability and gain 4[c]?"
