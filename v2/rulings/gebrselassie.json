    "question": "####[UFAQ 23](https://ancur.wikia.com/wiki/Whispers_in_Nalubaale_UFAQ) [Michael Boggs]\nHow exactly does Gebrselassie's ability affect the host icebreaker?",
    "answer": "Gebrselassie replaces any instance of an icebreaker resetting to base strength at the end of an encounter with resetting at the end of the turn. This includes the basic rule applied to any strength boost that does not specify a duration, as well as any strength boost that specifies the end of an encounter explicitly (such as [Takobi](/en/card/21026)). Gebrselassie does not have any effect on abilities that continuously modify strength (like [Na'Not'K](/en/card/12088)) or abilities that modify the strength of the host icebreaker for a different specified duration.\n\nSo how does Gebrselassie interact with a card like [Dean Lister](/en/card/13025)?",
