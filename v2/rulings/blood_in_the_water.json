    "answer": "The chosen number must be equal to the number of cards in the Runner’s grip at the time [RNG Key](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/21029)’s last sentence resolves during the access of [Blood in the Water](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33039). This is not necessarily the same as the number of cards in the Runner’s grip when the choice is made. For example, if the Runner has 4 cards in their grip when the run is declared successful, but suffers 1 net damage from [Hokusai Grid](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31059) before breaching the server, they will need to have chosen the number 3 in order to draw cards or gain credits with [RNG Key](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/21029).",
