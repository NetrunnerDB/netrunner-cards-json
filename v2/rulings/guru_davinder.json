    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nThe Runner has Guru Davinder and [Net Shield](/en/card/01045) installed when they suffer 1 net damage. Can they choose to use Net Shield, or are they forced to use Guru Davinder because his ability is constant versus Net Shield's paid ability? What if the Runner suffers 1 meat damage while Guru Davinder and [Muresh Bodysuit](/en/card/02044) are both installed (as they are both constant)?",
    "answer": "Guru Davinder prevents all net or meat damage, leaving nothing left for the Runner to use Net Shield on. In the case of Guru Davinder and Muresh Bodysuit, simultaneous triggers on cards are resolved in the order of their owner's choosing."
