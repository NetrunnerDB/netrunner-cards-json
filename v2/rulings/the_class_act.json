    "answer": "[Verbal Plasticity](en/card/30034)’s ability resolves immediately after the Runner pays the cost to take the basic action to draw 1 card, before the actual draw becomes imminent. [The Class Act](/en/card/26018)’s second ability resolves later, during the interrupt window that occurs while the draw effect is imminent. If both abilities are applicable, the Runner will look at 3 cards and put 1 of those cards on the bottom of their stack, then draw the other 2.",
