    "question": "If the Corp trashes a piece of ice (such as [Envelopment](/en/card/33060)) while the Runner is encountering it, then installs a new piece of ice protecting the same server with [Ob Superheavy Logistics](/en/card/33057), where is the Runner’s position relative to the newly installed ice?",
    "answer": "The Runner is inward from the new ice, so they will not approach it. When ice is uninstalled during a run, the Runner and all ice protecting the server immediately “collapse” their positions toward the root of the server. Ice cannot “jump in front of ” the Runner by trashing and installing midrun."
