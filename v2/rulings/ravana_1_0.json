    "question": "If the only rezzed bioroid ice are multiple copies of [Ravana 1.0](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31045), what happens if one of their subs resolves?",
    "answer": "A mandatory loop is created. The general rule is that the Corp chooses a number X and the loop continues X iterations and then stops. In this case the end result is that the subroutine does not have any effect for whatever number the Corp chooses."
