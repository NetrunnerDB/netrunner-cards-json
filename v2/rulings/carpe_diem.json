If an event instructs you to identify your mark, that server continues to be your mark for the remainder of the turn after that event resolves.",

    "answer": "The first time each turn the Runner resolves an instruction to identify their mark, they will randomly choose a central server. That server becomes their mark for the entire turn. Resolving another instruction to identify their mark will have no effect.",

    "answer": "No. To meet these abilities’ trigger conditions, the Runner must make a successful run on a server while that server is their mark. A previous successful run made before the attacked server became the Runner’s mark will not retroactively become a run on their mark. The Runner can still trigger these abilities by running the server again after it becomes their mark.",
