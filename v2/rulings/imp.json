    "question": "Why is [Imp](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31007)’s ability written differently than in previous printings?",
    "answer": "The previous wording for [Imp](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31007) and similar cards did not fit into any of the modern ability types that the CR supports, and it was not clear exactly when it could be used. The new “Access →“ flag lets this type of ability be written as a paid ability and gives it clear timing and structure."
