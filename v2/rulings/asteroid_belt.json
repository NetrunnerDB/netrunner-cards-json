    "question": "If an [Asteroid Belt](07012) has 4 hosted advancement counters, how much does it cost to rez it during a run made with [Tread Lightly](30012)?",
    "answer": "It would cost 0[c]. To determine what a cost is when effects are modifying its value, start with the default value for that cost ([Asteroid Belt](07012)’s printed rez cost is 9[c]), apply each effect that increases the cost ([Tread Lightly](30012) adds 3[c]), and then apply each effect that lowers the cost ([Asteroid Belt](07012)’s ability subtracts 3[c] for each hosted advancement counter)."
