    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nThe Corp has a scored [Sentinel Defense Program](/en/card/03007) when the Runner encounters a [Viktor 1.0](/en/card/01063) and cannot break the subroutines. How many copies of Ramujan-Reliant 550 BMI must be installed to prevent all the damage?",
    "answer": "The Runner only needs 1 copy of Ramujan-Reliant 550 BMI, which can be used to prevent the 1 brain damage from Viktor 1.0. Since Sentinel Defense Program requires the Runner to ‘’suffer’’ damage and not just be dealt damage, it does not trigger if the damage is prevented.\n\nDoes \"Limit 6 per deck.\" apply during a draft?"
