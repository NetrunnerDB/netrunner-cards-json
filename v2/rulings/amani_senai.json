    "question": "####[ANCUR](https://twitter.com/anr_ruleswiki) [UFAQ 22](http://ancur.wikia.com/wiki/The_Devil_and_the_Dragon_UFAQ) [Michael Boggs]\nIf the Corp scores Medical Breakthrough, what is the base trace strength for Amani Senai?",
    "answer": "Medical Breakthrough’s ability is active before Amani Senai’s ability resolves, so if it’s the first copy of Medical Breakthrough to be scored or stolen, the base trace strength will be 3. Each additional copy in a player’s score area would lower the base trace strength by another 1."
