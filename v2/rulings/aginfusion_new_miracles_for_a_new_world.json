    "question": "####[ANCUR](https://twitter.com/anr_ruleswiki) UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nIf the Corp uses [AgInfusion](/en/card/12052) to redirect the Runner to a different server, what happens if the outermost ice protecting the new server is unrezzed?",
    "answer": "If the outermost piece of ice is unrezzed, the Runner passes it and proceeds as normal for a run on the new server. There is no opportunity to rez the ice because the approach phase is skipped.\n \nIf the Corp uses [AgInfusion](/en/card/12052) to redirect the Runner to a different server with a rezzed piece of ice, can the Runner jack out before encountering that ice?"
