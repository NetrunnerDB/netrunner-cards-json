    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nWhat happens if the Runner has no installed cards or no credits when encountering Fairchild 1.0?",
    "answer": "When one of Fairchild 1.0's subroutines resolves, the Runner must follow the instructions to the extent that they are able. So if they have no credits, they will need to trash an installed card. If they have no installed cards, they will be forced to pay a credit. If they have neither credits nor installed cards, they will not be able to fulfill the instruction at all, so the subroutine does nothing."
