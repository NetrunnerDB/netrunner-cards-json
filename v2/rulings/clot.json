    "question": "When is the Runner’s last chance to use an ability like [Simulchip](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26085) to install [Clot](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31005) before the Corp can score an agenda?",
    "answer": "When the Corp places the last required advancement counter on an agenda during their turn, they will be the next player to receive priority, so they can score the agenda immediately. If the Runner wants to use [Clot](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31005) to prohibit the Corp from scoring, they must install it before the final advancement counter is placed on it. Note that sometimes more than one advancement counter can be placed at a time, such as with [Trick of Light](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31058), so the Runner may have to install [Clot](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31005) when they think the Corp still needs two more advancement counters to account for such effects.",
