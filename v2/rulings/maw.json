    "answer": "Yes. The Runner accessed a card and did not steal or trash it. Maw's trigger condition can only ever be met after an access ends, so it isn't a condition met by entering the \"accessing a card\" timing structure. Ending the access prematurely with Film Critic won't invalidate its trigger condition.\n\nIf the Runner does not steal or trash the first card they access in HQ, and that card is then randomly selected for Maw's trigger, is the card trashed to Archives faceup or facedown?",
