    "question": "If the Runner plays [Tinkering](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/25047) on an unrezzed [Ivik](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33045), then runs the server it is protecting, does it reduce its own cost when the Corp rezzes it?",
    "answer": "No. [Ivik](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33045) only counts rezzed code gates, and it is not rezzed until after the Corp pays its rez cost. However, if an ability checks [Ivik](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33045)’s rez cost afterward, it will count itself then."
