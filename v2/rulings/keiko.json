    "answer": "Yes. Keiko's trigger condition is met when installing a companion is complete, at step 8.3.6 in the rules for installing a card. Keiko becomes active before that, at step 8.3.5, so the ability is able to see that its trigger condition is met, and the Runner can trigger it and gain a credit.\n\nIf the Runner spends a credit from Paladin Poemu to install Keiko, can they trigger Keiko's ability?"
