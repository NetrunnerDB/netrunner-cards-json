Usually, there will be no cards to access during that breach, but [Aumakua](/en/card/12104)’s trigger condition is still met.",

If the run is made against the server with [NGO Front](/en/card/21039) in its root, the Corp will not be able to use that [NGO Front](/en/card/21039) until after the run ends, and then only if it is still installed. However, the Corp does have the opportunity to use [NGO Front](/en/card/21039) in the paid ability window before the Runner takes the action on [Light the Fire!](/en/card/33009). The Runner cannot use [Light the Fire!](/en/card/33009) immediately after installing it without giving the Corp an opportunity to trigger paid abilities.",
