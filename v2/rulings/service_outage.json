    "question": "####UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nCan the Runner initiate an effect that makes a run while Service Outage is active, then decline to pay the additional cost? If so, does that count as the “first run” on their turn?",
    "answer": "Yes, the additional cost can be declined (and the run does not initiate). This does not count as the first run, as no run was initiated."
