    "question": "If the Runner has [Spoilers](/en/card/08082) installed and the Corp scores [Longevity Serum](/en/card/30044), can the Corp choose to add the card trashed by Spoilers to R&D?",
    "answer": "No. The abilities on both [Spoilers](/en/card/08082) and [Longevity Serum](/en/card/30044) have the same trigger condition. Since agendas are always scored on the Corp’s turn, the Corp is the active player and must fully resolve their abilities before the Runner resolves any of theirs."
