    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nCan the Corp use Mumbad City Hall when there is only one card in R&D? Does it matter if that card is an alliance card?",
    "answer": "Yes, whether the last card is an alliance card or not. Since R&D is a hidden zone, the game doesn’t check whether the last card in R&D might meet the criteria for the search when determining if Mumbad City Hall’s ability has the potential to change the game state.\n\nCan the Corp use Mumbad City Hall when R&D is empty?"
