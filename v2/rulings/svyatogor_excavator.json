Can the Corp immediately use [Rashida Jaheem](/en/card/21080)’s ability?\n>No, [Rashida Jaheem](/en/card/21080) has the same trigger condition as [Svyatogor Excavator](/en/card/33059), and was not active when that trigger condition was met. Once a reaction window opens to handle pending conditional abilities for a particular trigger condition, new abilities cannot become pending for that trigger condition.",
