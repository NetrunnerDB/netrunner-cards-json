    "question": "####[NISEI](https://nisei.net) [Uprising Release Notes](https://nisei.net/files/Uprising_Release_Notes.pdf) [NISEI Rules Team]\nCan the Runner use Cordyceps to swap a piece of ice protecting the attacked server with ice hosted on Awakening Center?",
    "answer": "Yes, but only if that piece of ice is a rezzed bioroid, because Awakening Center is only a legal location for bioroid ice. If the ice is unrezzed, the Runner cannot demonstrate that the swap is legal. It does not matter if the ice was exposed earlier in the game or is otherwise known by the Runner; it only matters whether the Runner is allowed to see the bioroid subtype at the time Cordyceps's ability resolves. If a rezzed bioroid is swapped this way, the Corp will not be able to pay the cost to force the Runner to encounter it with Awakening Center's second ability unless another effect derezzes the bioroid."
