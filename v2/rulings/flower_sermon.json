    "answer": "If Flower Sermon's ability is the first time the Corp would draw cards in a turn, and no other relevant effects apply, then the Corp reveals the top card of R&D, then looks at the top 3 cards of R&D. They put one of those 3 cards on the bottom of R&D and draw the other 2. Finally, they put a card from HQ (which could be one of the drawn cards or another card) on top of R&D.\n\nWhat happens if the Corp uses Jinja City Grid to reveal and install all the cards they would draw while resolving Flower Sermon's ability?",
