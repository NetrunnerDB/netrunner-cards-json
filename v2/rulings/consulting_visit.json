    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nIf the Corp triggers [Mumbad City Hall](/en/card/10055) three times with [Jeeves Model Bioroids](/en/card/10067) rezzed, can they reveal Consulting Visit for the third usage of Mumbad City Hall and use the click from Jeeves to pay the additional cost?",
    "answer": "Yes. Jeeves Model Bioroids triggers off of the Corp paying the clicks, and due to the chain reaction rule it must resolve before Mumbad City Hall continues on to play the Consulting Visit.\n\nIf the Corp plays [Accelerated Diagnostics](/en/card/04052) and finds Consulting Visit and two other operations, can they play Consulting Visit followed by the other operations seen with Accelerated Diagnostics?"
