    "question": "####[ANCUR](https://twitter.com/anr_ruleswiki) [UFAQ 24](http://ancur.wikia.com/wiki/Reign_and_Reverie_UFAQ) [Michael Boggs]\nHow does Lady Liberty Work? Can the Corp use Lady Liberty to turn an agenda into a different number of agenda points?",
    "answer": "The phrase \"worth agenda points equal to the exact number of hosted power counters\" is a qualifier to \"an agenda\". The Corp can only use Lady Liberty on an agenda in HQ that is already worth as many agenda points as there are power counters hosted on Lady Liberty. The ability cannot change the number of points on an agenda because it is not a conversion effect using the word \"as\".\n\nAudited by NISEI Rules (2022.05)."
