    "answer": "No.\n\nThe Runner is playing [Armand \"Geist\" Walker](/en/card/08063), and [Fall Guy](/en/card/04106) and [Tech Trader](/en/card/10023) are the only installed resources. If the Corp plays Financial Collapse, can Geist attempt to trash Tech Trader for Financial Collapse, then prevent the trash with Fall Guy? What happens?"
