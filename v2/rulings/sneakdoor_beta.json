    "answer": "No, [Sneakdoor Beta](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31023) changes the attacked server while step 6.9.5a of the run is imminent, because the expected effects of that step include the trigger condition of [Sneakdoor Beta](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31023)’s delayed conditional ability, which is that the run on Archives would be declared successful. However, once the attacked server is changed to HQ, the imminent step cannot declare the run successful after all because of [Crisium Grid](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31079)’s ability. The Runner will still breach HQ.",

    "answer": "The Runner breaches Archives and the run is not declared successful. Since [Crisium Grid](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31079)’s ability is a static ability and applies immediately, declaring the run successful is never part of the expected effects of step 6.9.5a of the run, so the trigger condition of [Sneakdoor Beta](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31023)’s delayed conditional ability is never met and the ability never resolves.",
