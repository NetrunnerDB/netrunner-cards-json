    "question": "####[NISEI](http://nisei.net) [Downfall Release Notes](http://nisei.net/products/Downfall/DFReleaseNotes#QandAforDownfall) [NISEI Rules Team]\nWhen does Supercorridor check the number of credits the players have? If they have a different number of credits at the end of the Runner’s turn, but resolving another ability (such as Citadel Sanctuary) causes them to have the same number of credits, does the Runner gain 2<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span>?",
    "answer": "Supercorridor checks the number of credits the players have when its ability resolves. Even if the players have a different number of credits when the Runner’s turn ends, it will still trigger, and other abilities can cause Supercorridor to end up paying out."
