    "question": "####[Null Signal](https://nullsignal.games) [Null Signal Rules Team Update]\nCan the access from Mind's Eye be augmented with additional accesses from cards like [Akiko Nisei](/en/card/22015), [Nyashia](/en/card/21067), and [eXer](/en/card/21041)?",
    "answer": "Yes. Mind's Eye resolves the steps of the Timing Structure of Breaching a Server (section 11.4) as if the Runner had just made a successful run on R&D, including applying effects that modify accessing cards from R&D and setting the number of cards to access. However, you cannot access upgrades installed in the root of R&D with Mind's Eye, nor can you apply effects like The Turning Wheel that depend on a run being in progress.\n\nUpdated (2022.06).",
