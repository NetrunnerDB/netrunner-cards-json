    "question": "####[NISEI](https://nisei.net) [Uprising Release Notes](https://nisei.net/files/Uprising_Release_Notes.pdf) [NISEI Rules Team]\nThis card is a reprint. Has anything changed about how Cerebral Overwriter works?",
    "answer": "Only in the most technical sense. The newly updated wording and the rules for nested costs in CR 1.4 indicate that the 3[c] in Cerebral Overwriter's second ability is a cost, which was not clear before. But the ability functions essentially as it always did."
