    "question": "If the Runner chooses to use [Carnivore](/en/card/30003), can they draw with [René “Loup” Arcemont](/en/card/30001) before trashing cards from their grip?",
    "answer": "No. The Runner must fully resolve [Carnivore](/en/card/30003)’s ability before the trigger condition on *Loup*’s ability is met."

    "answer": "No. That subroutine prohibits the Runner from trashing cards they access in any way, not just by using the basic trash ability."
