    "question": "####[NISEI](https://nisei.net) [Uprising Release Notes](https://nisei.net/files/Uprising_Release_Notes.pdf) [NISEI Rules Team]\nIf the Runner has 4 or more agenda points and then steals Project Vacheron from a server other than Archives, do they win the game?",
    "answer": "No. When the Runner steals Project Vacheron, it will already have hosted agenda counters, and the ability changing its agenda point value will already be active, as it enters their score area. There is no point at which the Runner has agenda points from Project Vacheron until all the counters are removed.\n\nIf the Runner steals Project Vacheron during their turn, can the Corp play Game Over or Punitive Counterstrike on their next turn?"
