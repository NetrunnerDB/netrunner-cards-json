    "answer": "Yes. The restriction on running the server again is independent of the \"if successful\" ability.\n\nIf the Runner is redirected to a different remote server during a Marathon run, do they still gain <span class=\"icon icon-click\"></span> and add Marathon to their grip if the run is successful against the new server? Which server are they prohibited from running again during that turn?"
