    "question": "Can the Runner trash [No Free Lunch](/en/card/33020) to gain credits while another ability is resolving, such as when they are installing a card with [Gachapon](/en/card/26069) or contesting a trace from [Punitive Counterstrike](/en/card/31078)?",
    "answer": "No. The Runner can only use [No Free Lunch](/en/card/33020) when they have priority in a paid ability window."
