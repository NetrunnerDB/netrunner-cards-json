    "question": "If the Runner plays [Inside Job](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31018) and bypasses [Funhouse](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30054) or [Tollbooth](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31066), do the non-subroutine abilities on those cards resolve?",
    "answer": "No. An ability that meets its trigger condition due to an encounter beginning can only resolve if the encounter is still taking place. [Inside Job](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31018)’s bypass ability meets its trigger condition at the same time as [Funhouse](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30054) or [Tollbooth](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31066)’s ability, and as it’s the Runner’s turn, they will resolve the ability they control first. Bypassing a piece of ice immediately ends the encounter, stopping the Corp from resolving their ability before they can tag the Runner or charge a toll."
