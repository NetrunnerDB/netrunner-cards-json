    "question": "If the Runner steals an agenda with their first R&D access and uses [Pantograph](/en/card/30023) to install [eXer](/en/card/21041), can they access another card?",
    "answer": "No. The limit to how many cards the Runner can access from R&D is determined at the beginning of breaching R&D. If an ability that would modify a breach, such as [eXer](/en/card/21041)’s ability, becomes active after the Runner has accessed a card, then it is too late to affect that breach."
