    "question": "####[ANCUR](https://twitter.com/anr_ruleswiki) [UFAQ 24](http://ancur.wikia.com/wiki/Reign_and_Reverie_UFAQ) [Michael Boggs]\nCan the Corp play Divert Power but choose not to derez or rez any cards?",
    "answer": "Yes. To play Divert Power, it must have the potential to change the game state (via at least one rezzed card that can be derezzed and/or at least one unrezzed card that can be rezzed), but when the operation actually resolves, the Corp does not have to do anything since all of Divert Power's effects are adjustable.\n\nAudited by NISEI Rules (2022.07)."
