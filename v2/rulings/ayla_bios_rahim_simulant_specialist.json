    "question": "When exactly does the Runner set aside cards with [Ayla “Bios” Rahim](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31025), and how does the ability interact with taking a mulligan?",
    "answer": "The Runner should set aside the cards after revealing IDs and shuffling their deck, before drawing any cards. After setting aside cards and shuffling again, the Runner draws a starting hand. If the Runner chooses to take a mulligan, the set aside cards are not affected in any way, as those cards are no longer in the deck."
