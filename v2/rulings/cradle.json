    "question": "####[ANCUR](https://twitter.com/anr_ruleswiki) [UFAQ 24](http://ancur.wikia.com/wiki/Reign_and_Reverie_UFAQ) [Michael Boggs]\nCan Cradle have negative strength if the Runner has 6 or more cards in their grip? If so, what ice can Cradle break if its strength is negative?",
    "answer": "Yes, strength on both ice and icebreakers can be negative. An icebreaker's strength being negative does not affect its basic functionality; it can still only break subroutines on ice with strength less than or equal to the icebreaker's strength.\n\nAudited by NISEI Rules (2022.05)."
