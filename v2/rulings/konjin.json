    "answer": "If the Corp wins the Psi game, they choose another rezzed piece of ice and create a forced encounter with it. This means that an Encounter Ice Phase resolves for the chosen ice, but the Runner's position does not change: they are still in Konjin's position throughout, and they will not pass the other piece of ice. When that encounter ends, Konjin's ability is finished resolving and the game proceeds with the rest of the encounter with Konjin itself. So if Konjin has acquired any subroutines of its own, the Runner's opportunity to break those subroutines is after the forced encounter. See section 6.5.2 for more details.\n\nWhat happens if an \"end the run\" effect resolves during an encounter created by Konjin?",
