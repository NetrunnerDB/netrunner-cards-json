    "answer": "If the Runner already passed the uninstalled piece of ice, [Into the Depths](/en/card/33023) will remember that it was passed and count that toward the number of modes the Runner can resolve when the run is declared successful. If the ice is uninstalled while it is being encountered, the encounter immediately ends. The Runner passes that ice's former position, but since the ice is no longer there it does not count as the Runner passing a piece of ice."
