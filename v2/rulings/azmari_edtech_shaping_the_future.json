    "question": "####[ANCUR](https://twitter.com/anr_ruleswiki) [UFAQ 21](http://ancur.wikia.com/wiki/Council_of_the_Crest_UFAQ) [Michael Boggs]\nIf the Corp names \"event\" for the card type for Azmari EdTech, does the Corp still gain 2<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> if the Runner plays [Employee Strike](/en/card/09053)?",
    "answer": "No. Following the rules for playing events, \"when played\" abilities do not meet their trigger condition until the even in question is active in the play area. Employee Strike blanks Azmari EdTech as soon as it becomes active, so its ability is no longer active and cannot trigger."
