Can they then resolve [Malapert Data Vault](/en/card/30066)’s ability?\n>Yes and yes. When the Corp pays the additional cost to score [Azef Protocol](/en/card/33058), a checkpoint occurs before the score effect itself is resolved.  [Ob Superheavy Logistics](/en/card/33057) triggers at this checkpoint and resolves in time for [Malapert Data Vault](/en/card/30066) to be active when its trigger condition is met."

When the Corp pays the additional cost to score [Azef Protocol](/en/card/33058), a checkpoint occurs before the score effect itself is resolved.  [Ob Superheavy Logistics](/en/card/33057) triggers at this checkpoint and resolves fully before the game continues attempting to resolve scoring.

This is legal, but when the reaction window closes and the game proceeds, the score effect won't be able to find [Azef Protocol](/en/card/33058) because it is no longer installed."
