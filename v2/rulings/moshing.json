    "question": "####[NISEI](https://nisei.net) [Uprising Release Notes](https://nisei.net/files/Uprising_Release_Notes.pdf) [NISEI Rules Team]\nCan the Runner trash Moshing itself as one of the 3 cards trashed for its additional cost?",
    "answer": "No. An event is placed into the play area before its play cost is paid, so it is not a card in the grip at the time 3 cards need to be trashed."
