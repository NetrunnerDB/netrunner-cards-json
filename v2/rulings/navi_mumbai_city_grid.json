    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nDoes Navi Mumbai City Grid prohibit the Runner from using conditional abilities with costs, such as the subroutine breaking of [e3 Feedback Implants](/en/card/02024) or the derez of [Councilman](/en/card/10047)? What about the <span class=\"icon icon-click\"></span> to break ability provided on many bioroid pieces of ice?",
    "answer": "No, the Runner can still use all of those abilities. Even though those abilities involve paying a cost, paid abilities are always specifically written in the form “**cost**: effect”. Only those abilities are prohibited.",
