    "question": "####UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nIf the Runner accesses a card and then later trashes it outside of an access (e.g. with [Political Operative](/en/card/10043)), can the Corp play Hellion Beta Test on the next turn?",
    "answer": "No, Hellion Beta Test’s condition requires a card to have been trashed while it was being accessed.\n\nIf the Runner trashed only one Corp card on their last turn and subsequently used [Salsette Slums](/en/card/10059) to remove that card from the game, can the Corp still play Hellion Beta Test?"
