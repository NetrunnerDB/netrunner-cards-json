    "question": "####[ANCUR](https://twitter.com/anr_ruleswiki) UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nCan the Runner trash a card with [Aesop's Pawnshop](/en/card/01047) and then remove that same card from the heap with Bloo Moose?",
    "answer": "Yes. Both Aesop's Pawnshop and Bloo Moose meet their trigger conditions at the same time, so the Runner can choose the order in which the abilities trigger."
