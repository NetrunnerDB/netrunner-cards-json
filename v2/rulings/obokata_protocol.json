    "question": "####[ANCUR](https://twitter.com/anr_ruleswiki) UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nWhen the Runner accesses Obokata Protocol, can the Corp use [Tori Hanzō](/en/card/05022) to replace the net damage with brain damage? Does this prevent the Runner from stealing the agenda?",
    "answer": "The Corp cannot use Tori Hanzō's ability on the net damage from Obokata Protocol because Tori only works on net damage that is dealt by the Corp."
