    "answer": "The Runner has an opportunity to jack out after passing the last piece of ice protecting the server. The “last chance” you are looking for is the paid ability window just after this (step 4e)."

    "answer": "[Manegarm Skunkworks](/en/card/30042) will not affect this run unless it is rezzed in the root of Archives. [Omar Keung](/en/card/11043)’s ability moves the attacked server just before step 5a, which is after the step that can meet [Manegarm Skunkworks](/en/card/30042)’s trigger condition, step 4g."
