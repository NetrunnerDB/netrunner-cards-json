    "answer": "The Corp places 1 power counter on NASX. \"That many power counters\" refers to the number of credits \"up to 2\" that the Corp spends using the ability.\n\nDoes NASX trigger before or after the credits are gained? For example, if the Corp plays [Beanstalk Royalties](/en/card/01098) with an empty credit pool, can they use NASX at all?",
