    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nDoes the card swapped into Archives with Raman Rai enter faceup, facedown, or in the same state as the card swapped out of Archives?",
    "answer": "Facedown.\n\nThe Corp has Raman Rai and [Political Dealings](/en/card/10051) rezzed for the mandatory draw. If the Corp uses Raman Rai first to swap a drawn agenda with one in Archives, can the Corp then use Political Dealings to install the agenda swapped into Archives? What about the other way around?"
