    "question": "####[NISEI](https://nisei.net) [Uprising Release Notes](https://nisei.net/files/Uprising_Release_Notes.pdf) [NISEI Rules Team]\nThis card is a reprint. Has anything changed about how False Lead works?",
    "answer": "No. The original wording of False Lead used an “if able” clause to accomplish the same thing as the condition in the new wording, but we feel that the new wording is much clearer."
