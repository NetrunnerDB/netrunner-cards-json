    "answer": "Immediately after the operation resolves and is trashed from playing it, \"after you resolve this operation\" triggers meet their trigger condition. Ending the action phase then advances the game to the discard phase. This skips the paid ability window that would normally follow the end of an action, ceases the resolution of any other pending abilities or effects, and invalidates any conditional abilities. If the operation was played as part of a card ability, any remaining effects from that card ability immediately stop resolving as well.\n\nIf the Corp plays Psychokinesis as the first operation for [Subcontract](/en/card/10113), what happens?",
