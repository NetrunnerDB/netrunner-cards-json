    "answer": "Unless otherwise stated in the card text, the player who owns the card is always assumed to be the owner of any abilities on that card. Keros Mcintyre's ability only triggers if the Runner is responsible for the ice being derezzed. If a Corp card derezzes a piece of ice (e.g. [Test Ground](/en/card/08071)), or if a Runner card tells the Corp to derez a piece of ice (e.g. [Muertos Gang Member](/en/card/08068)), then Keros Mcintyre does not trigger.",
