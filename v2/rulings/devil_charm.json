    "answer": "Yes. Devil Charm and Chisel meet their trigger conditions at the same time, so the Runner can choose the order to trigger and resolve the two abilities. Chisel does not check the ice's strength until its ability resolves.\n\nIf the Runner uses Devil Charm to lower the strength of a piece of ice to a negative value during a run made with Prey, can the Runner trash that ice when they pass it? How many cards do they need to trash?",
