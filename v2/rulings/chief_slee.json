    "question": "####UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nIf an encountered piece of ice is trashed, does Chief Slee gain power counters?",
    "answer": "Yes. If an encountered piece of ice is uninstalled, then the encounter immediately ends.\n\nIf the Runner trashes [Hive](/en/card/04117) during the encounter while the Corp has 2 agenda points in their score area, how many power counters are placed on Chief Slee? What if the Runner encounters and trashes an ice that gains subroutines, like [Komainu](/en/card/05017)?"
