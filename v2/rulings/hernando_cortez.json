    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nIf a piece of ice will gain a subroutine from an effect like [Sensei](/en/card/02034) or [Komainu](/en/card/05017), does that subroutine factor into the additional cost for Hernando Cortez as well?",
    "answer": "No. Those effects cause the next piece of ice encountered to gain a subroutine, but ice is rezzed during the approach.\n\nHow many credits is the additional cost incurred for rezzing a piece of ice with flexible subroutines while Hernando Cortez's ability is active (such as [NEXT Silver](/en/card/06002), [Ashigaru](/en/card/06064), [Tour Guide](/en/card/08118), etc.)?"
