    "question": "####UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nIf [Employee Strike](/en/card/09053) is active when either an agenda is scored or another current is played, can Skorpios Defense Systems remove it from the game?",
    "answer": "No. Employee Strike is active until it is trashed, so Skorpios doesn’t have its ability in time to see the trigger condition being met.\n\nIf the Runner trashes multiple cards at once, such as through damage from [Scorched Earth](/en/card/01099) or through [MaxX's](/en/card/07029) ability, does the Corp have to choose one at a time which card to remove from the game as damage is picked?",
