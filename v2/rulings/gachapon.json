What happens if another effect moves or shuffles cards within the stack while Gachapon is resolving?",
    "answer": "Cards that are set aside are in their own zone and are no longer in their previous location. See the notes on the set-aside zone, above. Other effects that manipulate the stack cannot affect the cards from Gachapon while they are set aside.\n\nHow do set-aside cards interact with Paige Piper?"
