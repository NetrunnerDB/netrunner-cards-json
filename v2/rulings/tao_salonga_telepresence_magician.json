    "question": "If the Runner is playing as [Tāo Salonga](/en/card/30019) and manages to steal an agenda during an encounter, can they use his ability to change the attacked server by moving the currently encountered ice to another server?",
    "answer": "Yes. If a piece of ice moves while the Runner is encountering it, the Runner moves with the ice."

    "question": "Can the Runner use [Tāo Salonga](/en/card/30019) to swap a piece of ice protecting a server with ice hosted on ​[Awakening Center​](/en/card/03021)?",
    "answer": "Yes, but only if that piece of ice is a rezzed ​**bioroid​**, because [Awakening Center​](/en/card/03021) is only a legal location for ​**bioroid​** ice. If the ice is unrezzed, the Runner cannot demonstrate that the swap is legal. It does not matter if the ice was exposed earlier in the game or is otherwise known by the Runner; it only matters whether the Runner is allowed to see the **​bioroid​** subtype at the time Tāo’s ability resolves. If a rezzed **bioroid​** is swapped this way, the Corp will not be able to pay the cost to force the Runner to encounter it with [Awakening Center​](/en/card/03021)​’s second ability unless another effect derezzes the ​**bioroid​**."
