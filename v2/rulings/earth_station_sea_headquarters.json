    "answer": "The game state is now illegal, so in the next checkpoint after Earth Station's ability becomes active again, the Corp must choose exactly 1 remote server they will keep. The game trashes all cards in and protecting all other remote servers. This trashing cannot be prevented.\n\nWhat happens if the previous situation occurs while Architect is rezzed protecting a remote server?"
