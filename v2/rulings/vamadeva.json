    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nThe Runner encounters a [Tyrant](/en/card/02078) with a single advancement token on it and breaks the subroutine with Vamadeva. If the Corp then uses [Firmware Updates](/en/card/07004) to add another advancement token to Tyrant, can the Runner break the new subroutine with Vamadeva?",
    "answer": "No. Broken subroutines still exist on the ice.\n\nCan the Runner use Vamadeva to swap in another copy of Vamadeva from the grip?"
