    "answer": "A card is \"used\" if its controller makes a choice to trigger or resolve any optional ability or part of an ability with that card as its source, or if its controller spends or moves counters to pay costs because of an ability from that card. See section 9.1.6 in CR 1.4.\n\nOK, that was a confusing answer. Can we talk about the kinds of \"using\" one at a time?"
