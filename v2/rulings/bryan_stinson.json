    "answer": "Paywall Implementation will be removed from the game instead of trashed whenever it would normally get trashed: once an agenda is stolen or another current is played. Once Bryan Stinsonâ€™s ability is triggered, it exists independently of Bryan Stinson, so Paywall Implementation will still be removed from game instead of being trashed even if Bryan Stinson is trashed before that happens.\n\nIf the Corp plays a terminal transaction with Bryan Stinson, such as [Violet Level Clearance](/en/card/11111), does it still get removed from the game?",
