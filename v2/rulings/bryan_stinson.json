    "question": "####UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nIf the Corp plays [Paywall Implementation](/en/card/06028) with Bryan Stinson, does it get removed from the game? If so, when? What if the Runner trashes Bryan Stinson before an agenda is stolen or another current is played?",
    "answer": "Paywall Implementation will be removed from the game instead of trashed whenever it would normally get trashed: once an agenda is stolen or another current is played. Once Bryan Stinson’s ability is triggered, it exists independently of Bryan Stinson, so Paywall Implementation will still be removed from game instead of being trashed even if Bryan Stinson is trashed before that happens.\n\nIf the Corp plays a terminal transaction with Bryan Stinson, such as [Violet Level Clearance](/en/card/11111), does it still get removed from the game?",
