    "answer": "No. [Seamless Launch](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30040) will resolve and be trashed before a paid ability window occurs in which the Corp could score [Regenesis](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33040).",

    "answer": "If the Corp uses [Moon Pool](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33042) on their turn and does not trash any cards from HQ with its ability, they can still meet the condition on [Regenesis](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33040). [Moon Pool](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33042) itself is removed from the game by its ability, so it never enters Archives.",
