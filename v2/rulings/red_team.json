    "question": "If the Runner uses [Sneakdoor Beta](/en/card/31023) to run Archives and then switch to HQ, does [Red Team](/en/card/30018) count that as a run on Archives or HQ?",
    "answer": "[Red Team](/en/card/30018) cares about the server the Runner declared to be the attacked server at the beginning of the run. Therefore, it will always count a run made with [Sneakdoor Beta](/en/card/31023) as a run against Archives. The Runner will not be able to use [Red Team](/en/card/30018) to run Archives later in the turn."
