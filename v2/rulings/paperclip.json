    "question": "####UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nCan the Runner spend credits on [Cloak](/en/card/03041) to install Paperclip from the heap?",
    "answer": "No. While triggering Paperclip’s ability from the heap is considered using Paperclip, paying the install cost is part of the install action and not a cost of using the ability.\n\nCan the Runner use Paperclip’s paid ability even if its strength doesn’t match a piece of ice?"
