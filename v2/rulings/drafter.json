    "answer": "No. The new ice must be installed in the outermost position protecting the server. Since the Runner already has a position relative to the other ice protecting the server, the new ice will necessarily have a position outward from the Runner. Trashing multiple ice does not allow new ice to \"leapfrog\" the Runner's position, but just moves the Runner 1 position toward the server for each trashed piece of ice that was inward from their earlier position.",
