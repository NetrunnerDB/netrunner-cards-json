    "answer": "No. The Runner is still accessing cards while they are being forced to encounter the ice. However, they are no longer accessing Ganked! itself, because Ganked! is trashed as part of resolving its ability. When the forced encounter ends, resolving Ganked!'s ability is complete, and the game proceeds with the remaining accesses from the set of cards being accessed.\n\nWhat happens if an \"end the run\" effect resolves during an encounter created by Ganked!?"

    "question": "If [Karunā](30047)’s first subroutine resolves while the Runner is already breaching the attacked server (perhaps because of [Ganked!](26119)), can the Runner still jack out? Does that stop them from accessing any more cards?",
    "answer": "Yes and yes. Nothing stops the Runner from jacking out at unusual times if given the opportunity by a card ability. Jacking out ends the run, which ends any breach in progress as well."
