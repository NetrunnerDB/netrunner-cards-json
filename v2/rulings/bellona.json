    "answer": "Yes. There is not normally a cost to steal an agenda, so the Runner is paying a cost because of a Corp card ability.\n\nIf the Runner steals Bellona with 2 advancement counters on it while NAPD Cordon is active, how many different costs do they pay? How many times can the Corp trigger GameNET?"
