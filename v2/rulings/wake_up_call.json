    "question": "####[ANCUR](https://twitter.com/anr_ruleswiki) UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nCan the Corp use Wake Up Call to trash [Jarogniew Mercs](/en/card/12062) while other resources are installed?",
    "answer": "Yes. The Runner is the player specified to trash the chosen card, so Jarogniew Mercs's second ability does not apply.\n\nCan the Corp play Wake Up Call if the Runner does not have an installed hardware or non-virtual resource, and if so is the Runner forced to suffer the meat damage?"
