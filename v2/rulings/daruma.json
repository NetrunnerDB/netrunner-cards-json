    "question": "####[ANCUR](https://twitter.com/anr_ruleswiki) [UFAQ 24](http://ancur.wikia.com/wiki/Reign_and_Reverie_UFAQ) [Michael Boggs]\nCan the Corp use a Daruma that is installed in the root of a central server?",
    "answer": "No. Daruma swaps out a card installed in the same server from which it was trashed. There are no cards installed in central servers, only the inactive cards in the Corp’s hand/deck/discard and the cards installed in the root.\n\nWhat about using Daruma in a remote server to swap something into the root of a central server?"
