    "answer": "If an encounter with Engram Flush is in progress and its conditional ability has resolved, the Corp can trash a card of the chosen type, regardless of whether the subroutine is resolving due to the normal progression of a run or because of a card ability. If a subroutine on Engram Flush resolves outside of an encounter with it, or during an encounter in which no card type was chosen (perhaps due to Hunting Grounds's first ability), the Corp only reveals the grip and cannot trash anything.\n\nIf the Corp is playing Harishchandra Ent. and the Runner is tagged, can the Corp reveal the grip and trash a card with Engram Flush?"
