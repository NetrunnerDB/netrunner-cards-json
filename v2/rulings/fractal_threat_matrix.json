    "answer": "If Troll's \"when encountered\" ability ends the run, then the Runner will not have reached step 3.1 of the run and thus will not have had the chance to break any subroutines. If Troll does not end the run, the Runner is considered to have broken all 0 subroutines on Troll, thus triggering Fractal Threat Matrix.\n\nThe Runner encounters an [Ashigaru](/en/card/06064) protecting HQ, and the Corp has [Panic Button](/en/card/04072) and Fractal Threat Matrix installed. Each time the Runner breaks all the remaining subroutines on Ashigaru, the Corp uses Panic Button to add another subroutine to Ashigaru. Does Fractal Threat Matrix trigger each tim eht Runner breaks the added subroutines?",
