    "question": "Why is [Quetzal](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31001)’s ability written differently than in previous printings?",
    "answer": "The old wording of [Quetzal](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31001)’s ability did not fit into any of the modern ability types that the CR supports. In practice, it always worked like a paid ability, but now it’s written as one so that it’s clear what timing and other rules apply to it."
