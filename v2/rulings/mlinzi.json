    "answer": "No. The Runner must be able to pay the full cost in cards trashed in order to not suffer the net damage. (This reverses a previous ruling, which did not consider Mlinzi’s effects using the rules for costs. Since rule 1.15.1c now makes clear that trashing cards from the stack in Mlinzi’s subroutines is a cost, those rules should be applied.)"
