    "answer": "The Runner cannot spend clicks on taking actions until \"Take actions\" during step 1.4 of their turn. Before that step of the turn, clicks can still be lost or spent through card effects, such as [Wyldside](/en/card/01016) or Bioroid ice during a run initiated by a card effect. A click gained during step 2.3 after the action phase does not return the runner to the action phase, and it will not be available to spend until the Runner’s next action phase because clicks can only be gained or spent during a player’s own turn. However, it can still be lost by card effects (for example, if the Corp plays [An Offer You Can't Refuse](/en/card/08091) and resolves the first subroutine on an [Enigma](/en/card/01111)).",

    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nThe Runner uses a power counter from Temple of the Liberated Mind in turn step 1.1 (before \"Turn begins\") or step 2.3 (before \"End of turn\"). Can the gained <span class=\"icon icon-click\"></span> be spent on actions at either of these times?"
