    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nCan Populist Rally be played if the Corp has 0 clicks to spend on their next turn?",
    "answer": "No. As the Corp cannot have fewer than 0 clicks to spend on their next turn, playing Populist Rally would not cause a change in game state and thus cannot be played."
