    "answer": "Project Yagi-Uda explicitly allows the Runner to jack out right after the swap occurs, regardless of when the ability is used. If a piece of ice is swapped while it is being approached, the Runner is still approaching that position and the Corp can rez the new piece of ice. If a piece of ice is swapped to HQ while being encountered, the encounter will end and the Runner will proceed to pass the position now occupied by the ice swapped from HQ.\n\nCan the Corp swap a card in HQ with a card in R&D or Archives?",
