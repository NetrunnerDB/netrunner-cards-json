    "question": "Can the Runner play [Emergency Shutdown](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31016) on their second click after they ran HQ with an active [Crisium Grid](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31079) that was trashed during the breach?",
    "answer": "No, the Runner did not make a successful run on HQ due to [Crisium Grid](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31079)’s ability. Trashing [Crisium Grid](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31079) does not retroactively make the run successful."
