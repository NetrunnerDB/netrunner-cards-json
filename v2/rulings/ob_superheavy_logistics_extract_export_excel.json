    "question": "If the Corp trashes a [Border Control](/en/card/23054) to end the run and then uses [Ob Superheavy Logistics](/en/card/33057) to search for an [Anemone](/en/card/33043), can they also trigger [Anemone](/en/card/33043)'s rez ability?",
    "answer": "Yes, as long as the [Anemone](/en/card/33043) is installed protecting the attacked server. The search effect from [Ob Superheavy Logistics](/en/card/33057) and any resulting chain reactions are resolved immediately after paying the cost of [Border Control](/en/card/23054)'s ability, before the \"End the run.\" instruction resolves, so the condition on [Anemone](/en/card/33043)'s ability can still be met."

    "question": "Can the Corp use [Ob Superheavy Logistics](/en/card/33057) to search R&D for a card when they trash a card with rez cost 0?",
    "answer": "Yes, but since there are no cards with a printed rez cost less than 0, they will fail to find any cards and simply shuffle R&D. Note that the ability was still used, even if no card was installed, so it cannot be used again that turn."

    "answer": "The shuffle happens before drawing cards. Trashing [Rashida Jaheem](/en/card/21080) is a nested cost, which requires a checkpoint to occur after it is paid. [Ob Superheavy Logistics](/en/card/33057) triggers at this checkpoint and resolves before the rest of [Rashida Jaheem](/en/card/21080)’s ability resolves."

    "answer": "The Corp can search for and install [Daily Quest](/en/card/26048), but if it is not their action phase, it will remain unrezzed. The Corp must reveal the card to show that it cannot be rezzed."

Can they then resolve [Malapert Data Vault](/en/card/30066)’s ability?",
    "answer": "Yes and yes. When the Corp pays the additional cost to score [Azef Protocol](/en/card/33058), a checkpoint occurs before the score effect itself is resolved.

    "answer": "Yes. “Ignoring credit costs” includes both increases to rez costs like the one imposed by [Tread Lightly](/en/card/30012) and additional costs consisting of credits like the one imposed by [Hernando Cortez](/en/card/11004)."

    "answer": "No. The trigger condition on [Ob Superheavy Logistics](/en/card/33057) only looks for cards trashed by the Corp, and cards trashed because of uniqueness are trashed by the game rules, not by a player."

    "answer": "If the additional cost is paying credits, that cost is already being ignored, so the Corp cannot decline to pay it. If the additional cost is anything other than credits, such as the additional cost on [Archer](/en/card/31075), the Corp can decline to pay it. If they decline, the card will not be rezzed, but they must reveal the card to show why it was not rezzed."

    "answer": "The Runner is inward from the new ice, so they will not approach it. When ice is uninstalled during a run, the Runner and all ice protecting the server immediately “collapse” their positions toward the root of the server. Ice cannot “jump in front of ” the Runner by trashing and installing midrun."

    "answer": "No. The Corp’s opportunity to use [Ob Superheavy Logistics](/en/card/33057) is immediately after the cost of [Alexa Belsky](/en/card/11055)’s ability is paid, before the ability resolves. No cards will have been shuffled from HQ into R&D yet."

    "answer": "Yes. Trashing [Daruma](/en/card/22041) is paying a nested cost, so it is immediately followed by a checkpoint. The ability on [Ob Superheavy Logistics](/en/card/33057) resolves in full before the game continues to the instruction to swap cards in [Daruma](/en/card/22041)’s ability, so the newly installed card is available as a possible target for that instruction."

    "answer": "It is not possible to do this and still score the [Azef Protocol](/en/card/33058). When the Corp pays the additional cost to score [Azef Protocol](/en/card/33058), a checkpoint occurs before the score effect itself is resolved.  [Ob Superheavy Logistics](/en/card/33057) triggers at this checkpoint and resolves fully before the game continues attempting to resolve scoring. If the Corp chooses to install an asset in the root of the server that currently contains [Azef Protocol](/en/card/33058), they must trash [Azef Protocol](/en/card/33058) as part of installing the asset. This is legal, but when the reaction window closes and the game proceeds, the score effect won't be able to find [Azef Protocol](/en/card/33058) because it is no longer installed."

    "answer": "Yes, but there must be a card the Corp can advance installed before they begin this process. If there are no installed cards the Corp can advance, the game does not consider [Reconstruction Contract](/en/card/21020)’s ability to have the potential to change the game state."

Does it matter what other cards are in the root of the server with [Calibration Testing](/en/card/21017) when they begin this process?",
    "answer": "Yes, the Corp can do this, as long as the new card is installed in the root of the same server from which [Calibration Testing](/en/card/21017) is trashed. It is not relevant whether other cards are installed in the root of the server. The game checks if [Calibration Testing](/en/card/21017)’s ability has the potential to change the game state before the card is trashed, so it sees [Calibration Testing](/en/card/21017) itself as a potential target and allows the Corp to use the ability."
