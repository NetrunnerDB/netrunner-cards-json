    "question": "When the Corp installs ice with the first subroutine on [Brân 1.0](/en/card/30039), can they trash other ice? Can they trash [Brân 1.0](/en/card/30039) itself? What happens if they do?",
    "answer": "Yes, the procedure for installing ice is followed normally, except for the destination position being behind [Brân 1.0](/en/card/30039) instead of the outermost position. However, the relative position of each piece of ice protecting the server is established before any cards are trashed. If [Brân 1.0](/en/card/30039) is trashed, the encounter will end as soon as the install effect is complete, no more of its subroutines will resolve, and the Runner’s next position will correspond to the newly-installed ice."

    "question": "Does the Corp have to pay to rez ice installed with [Brân 1.0](/en/card/30039)?",
    "answer": "Yes. The “ignoring all costs” clause only applies while the ice is being installed, not when it is later approached and rezzed."
