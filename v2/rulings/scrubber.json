    "question": "What is the credit symbol with the arrow on [Scrubber](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31011) and what does it do?",
    "answer": "That symbol means “recurring credits”, and it means that after a player installs (or rezzes, for Corp cards) the card it appears on, they should place the indicated number of credits on it (in [Scrubber](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31011)’s case, 2 of them). Then, for as long as the card remains active, the player “refills” the card up to the indicated number of credits just before their turn begins. If there are already as many credits as the number indicated (or more), then no more credits will be added.",

    "question": "The wording on [Scrubber](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31011) looks a little different. Has anything changed about how the Runner can spend its credits?",
    "answer": "Only the interaction with [Salsette Slums](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/10059) has changed, and it is restored to the original state of that interaction before [Salsette Slums](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/10059) received its first errata. The new wording for [Scrubber](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31011) allows the Runner to spend its hosted credits when paying any cost that refers to a card’s trash cost, including the basic trash ability and the current wording of [Salsette Slums](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/10059). While [Political Operative](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/10043) previously used a wording that would be compatible with this requirement, it has never previously been able to work with [Scrubber](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31011), and so has received otherwise-nonfunctional errata to maintain this non-interaction.",
