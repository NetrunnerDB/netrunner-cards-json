    "question": "Does [Ice Carver](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31009) apply its -1 strength before or after [Chisel](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26003)’s ability resolves?",
    "answer": "Before. [Ice Carver](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31009) has a static ability, which means it applies as soon as the encounter begins. The Runner doesn’t have to trigger the ability explicitly or wait for conditional abilities to resolve before it takes effect."
