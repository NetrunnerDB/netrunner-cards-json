    "question": "####[ANCUR](https://twitter.com/anr_ruleswiki) [UFAQ 23](http://ancur.wikia.com/wiki/Whispers_in_Nalubaale_UFAQ) [Michael Boggs]\nDoes Slipstream work if the ice is uninstalled during the encounter?",
    "answer": "No. Though ice is immediately passed if it is derezzed or uninstalled while being encountered, it then is no longer a rezzed piece of ice, so it does not meet Slipstream's trigger condition.\n\nHow is ice position determined for Sipstream?"
