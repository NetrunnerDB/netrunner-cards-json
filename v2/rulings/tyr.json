If the Corp uses Tyr's Hand to prevent a subroutine from being broken after a click is spent, do they still get the extra allotted [click] next turn? What if the Runner breaks the last subroutine using Týr's ability and then immediately uses Hippo to trash it (so that Týr is not active for a conditional ability to resolve)?",
