    "question": "####[ANCUR](https://twitter.com/anr_ruleswiki) UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nWhen the Corp scores Mandatory Seed Replacement, can they change the number of ice protecting  a server or create new servers with the available ice?",
    "answer": "No. The same amount of ice must be protecting each server after the rearrangement as before, and thus no new servers can be created through the rearrangement."
