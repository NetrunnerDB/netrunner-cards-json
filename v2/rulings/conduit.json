If [Conduit](/en/card/30024) is trashed before this, there are no longer any hosted counters, so the Runner will not access any additional cards.",

    "answer": "Yes. The limit to how many cards the Runner can access from R&D is determined at the beginning of breaching R&D. Once accessing cards begins, changing the number of virus counters on [Conduit](/en/card/30024) will have no effect on the breach already in progress.",
