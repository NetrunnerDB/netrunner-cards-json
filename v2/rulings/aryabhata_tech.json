    "answer": "Yes. The “if successful” effects of a trace are constant effects, so they always resolve before any abilities triggered by the successful trace.\n\nIf the Runner has 4<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> when the trace on Virgo is successful and boosted to at least trace strength 5, can the Runner avoid both tags with New Angeles City Hall before losing 1<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> to Aryabhata Tech?"
