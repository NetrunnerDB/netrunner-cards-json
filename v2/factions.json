The process has become so advanced that these anthropomorphic “labor solutions” almost seem human. Almost.\nThe availability of bioroids has changed the worlds forever. Corporations and the wealthy race to replace their workers, leaving the lower classes fighting for scraps. But bioroids also exceed human capabilities: they can work in conditions that no human can withstand. The synthetic athletes from HB’s Sportsmetal division showcase their faster reflexes, agility, and strength for a popular audience. Brain scans also work in the digital realm. Using the same software as bioroid brains, HB has created ice that can learn, adapt, and outsmart intruders.\nBeyond bioroids, HB’s patents on neural channeling and cybernetics grant them dominance in the fields of prosthetic design and industrial manufacturing. They undercut the competition with inhuman efficiency and precision engineering on both Earth and Luna.",

They are best known for their monopoly on clone production, competing with Haas-Bioroid by pushing aggressively into labor markets with specialized, gengineered clones. Rumor has it that they take desired traits from animal genetics, but Jinteki has refused to reveal their trade secrets.\nAnd Jinteki takes their secrets very seriously. Although they seldom deign to dirty their hands with wetwork operations, they have no problem setting up traps for an unsuspecting Runner and rezzing dangerous ice. Another criminal fried by their own rig is a tragedy, but not a liability.\nRunners tell stories about their runs against Jinteki, being thwarted at every turn, as if someone could anticipate their every move. It is alleged that Jinteki uses their clone projects to research the potential of human psionic ability, but serious scientists dismiss these claims.\nJinteki remains silent on the matter.",
