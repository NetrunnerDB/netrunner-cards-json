In a megacity on the rise, no one noticed his own brutal, bloody elevation until he’d entrenched himself at the top. Now, he does business with the wealthy and powerful, as likely to shake hands with an exec as he is to get his hands dirty on the streets.\n\nYeah, sometimes that business means turning on the corp he did a favor for last week. So what? They’ll need him again, eventually, and all will be forgiven. Things move fast in Kota Kali.",
