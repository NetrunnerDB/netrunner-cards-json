Now an ormas leader, Topan helps achieve their goal: empowering Dayak people.\n\nSome question Topan’s methods. “Too preman,” people mutter, as Topan uses standover tactics that rival a prisec team. “Too girly,” others say, watching Topan extract information with a wink and a low-cut blouse. Topan doesn’t care. Dayaks are losing their forest to a space elevator, their livelihoods to androids. It’s no time for ‘proper’ methods.",
