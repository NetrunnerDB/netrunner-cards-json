Throughout this maze are certain unlit corridors; locked, nameless offices; entire windowless floors of corporate headquarters that exude an aura of somebody else’s problem.\n\nIt is within those oubliettes that the Zwicky Group can be found, should they allow it. It is from those darkened corners that their grasp extends, silently alighting wherever Weyland cannot be seen to be.",
