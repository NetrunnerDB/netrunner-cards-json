  "narrative_text": "When MuslihaT graduated from KKU with top marks, she never expected to be rejected from her dream job at NBN. She tried again: rejected, and the same from every other megacorp. So, she set up her own one-woman marketing firm. Using botnets, aliases, and borrowed avatars, the local businesses she promoted suddenly gained traction. Meanwhile, their competitors experienced scathing reviews and faulty orders. MuslihaT was out to prove herself. She’d be plucky, clever and win against the powerful—just like her beloved Sang Kancil.",
