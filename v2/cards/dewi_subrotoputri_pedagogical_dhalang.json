Finally, she found her calling in Solo’s 1000-year-old style of wayang kulit.\nThe clear morality and timeless characters allow her to pass judgment on current events. When the audience has her back, she can improvise, splice in some corp secrets.\nTraditions that can adapt are traditions that survive, and through Dewi, they might even thrive.",
